POM--> Page object model

we are storing the elements in the page
class, and from the page class we are accessing those
elements through out the test

it will avoid the duplicates 
page class is act as a page element repo

for example:
you login functions
the login step is the first step of all the cases
you have 1000 test cases
now this login step used in all 1000 test cases
username text box
password text box
it is used in all 1000 places 



DataDriven
---------------
multiple set of datas to the test or a particular filed
and have to validate the different outcomes
pass +ve and -ve data --> and have validate the results
