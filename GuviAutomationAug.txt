What is Software
------------------

instruction
program to reduce work
combination program and data
            Processor --> 8085 micro processor (Intel, silicon, snapdragon,media tech)
01010101  ------------>     power
software --> communicate with machine --->

software mainly used to operate a machine
we are passing instruction to the software by using basic language(communication language)(data)
software will convert instruction in to binary --> OS --> processor convert binaries into electrical power --> hardware

Why we are using software
--------------------------
save time and effort

simplify the manual effort

Types of software
-----------------
System software (firmware, os(windows, mac, android, ios, linux, simbion))
application software(any software is running on top of os then it is called as application)
Driver software --> (Display driver, audio drivers)
Middleware --> application - application or application to os
web applications --> 
Hybrid applications

Type of API's
--------------
Rest API 
Soap API

Type of SDLC Model
--------------------
Waterfall model
V model
prototype model
iterative incremental model
spiral model
agile

Waterfall model
----------------
Water fall model is very first model



Testing Methodologies
-------------------------

White box testing
--------------------
glass box testing or transparent testing or unit testing

White box testing is done by dev team

path coverage,
statement coverage
cyclometric complexity
Branch coverage

once the dev completed the coding they will check the code is satisfying the requirement


pytest,pyunit, junit, Nunit

dev environment 
test environment
uat environment
prod environment
prod1 environment
prod2 environment


environments(dev, test, )


def add(a, b){

	return a+b
}



def test_add(){

assert add(3, 4), 7

}


Black Box Testing
------------------

once white box testing is completed the dev will give working software to the testing
now as a tester we have to perform black box testing

bbt is also called as close box, opal testing


as a tester we have to create test cases and will execute those cases on UI to check the business functions

we dont have access for internal code

black testing is done by testers

Functional testing
-------------------
Smoke testing
	Build --> version of working software
	
	smoke testing is to verify the build is capable to perform extensive testing
that mean we have to check the application is satisfying the basic functionalities at least
smoke testing is also called as build verification testing.


There is not test cases for smoke testing

Why
------

1000 

Basic flow
	

sanity testing

	dont have time to perform detailed regression we have to go for sanity
verify the basic flow and as well as have check the related components.

regression testing

Regression testing--> 

	Previous build executed 1000 
	900 --> passed
	100 --> failed --> reported --> dev --> fix --> develop and integrate any other new features
	
	execute passed cases in the new build



retesting

	execute failed test cases on the new version of the software 

integration testing
	
	Incremental integration testing
		topdown  --> stubs
		bottom up --> drivers
		Sandwich --> hybrid --> combination of both topdown and bottom up

	 		
	the app will get stable in quicker way
	less chance for application failure
	will archive test coverage.
	


	Non incremental integration testing(BigBang)
	
		


	

e2e testing

once all the modules are integrated and the application completly ready we can go for e2e integration testing
will check all the features to gather as a single system.

localization testing



globalization testing
Adhoc testing --> Pair testing, buddy testing, Monkey testing  -->

Pair testing
-------------

sr tester 
jn tester 


buddy testing
--------------
tester 
dev



Gorilla testing
Exploratory testing



User acceptance testing


Nonfunctional testing
----------------------
Performance testing
----------------------

	load testing
		
		load --> number of users
		

		10cr
	at a time the max number users hitting the application 
	
	we have to make sure, the behaviour of an application is as expected
	
	
	jmeeter, astra load, load ninja, load runner
	
		
	stress testing(Spick testing)		

	volume testing

		


	Endurance testing




security testing

	sql injections

	pen testing


usability testing


Gray box testing
------------------

graybox --> black box + whitebox

is performed by dev or tester who are having programming knowledge
we dont have full access for code but will have full access for ui


API testing 
Database Testing



Boundary value analysis
Equivalence class portioning

if you think values range is huge and reduce the number of test cases 
but we are arch test coverages




Negative testing
------------------
1 positive test should have atleast one negative

Software testing life cycle
-------------------------------

stlc is part of sdlc


Define the scope of testing
Develop a test strategy
The test strategy defines how you plan to implement testing. Your testers should all be working off the same game plan, so make sure every member of the team is aware of what they're supposed to be doing at any given time.
Define the test objective
Choose testing tools
Find bugs early
Define your test criteria
Entry criteria
----------------
Test Basis --> availability of testable(req, user stories, specification)
Test Objective --> component or system available and stable
Test Environment --> hardware and software and tools are setup and ready
Test Data --> sufficient test data available for test
Resources --> Availability of testers
Approved test plan 



Exit criteria
-------------
Test Completion -->  % of test cases have to be executed atleast once
Defect Resolution --> There is not critical or high priority issues are in the system every thing have to be fixed

Quality Metrics: have to archive % of test coverage(all the features and components are tested)

Stackholder approval: reviewed and approved the test results
Resource availability: Resources required for the next stage are available
 
Resource planning--> testers availability and allocating the tests

Plan your test environment--> Hard ware , software, tools have to be setup for test execution 

Plan test team logistics --> hardware logistics
Schedule & estimation --> duration and cost estimation
Test deliverables --> outcome of the test
Test automation ---> what have to be automated and executed


Error
------
Executing the code and finding some issue in that then it is called as error
when we are performing unit testing if we facing any issues it will be called as error

dev terminology

Bug
-----
testers terminology
when the error is not found in the unit test and it is observed in the testing environment by the tester is called as bug


Defect
-------
If users are facing issues in the prod environment then it is called as defect
issue due to error in the code.

Failure:
---------

if end user is finding there is a function is implemented in wrong way or gap in the requirement

or the application is not meeting the requirement


fault:
-------

if any function is not working(blocker, ship stopper) in the production environment it is called as fault.


Bug life cycle
---------------
Bug Life Cycle
In software development process, the bug has a life cycle. The bug should go through the life cycle to be closed A specific life cycle ensures that the process is standardized The bug attains different states in the life cycle The life cycle of the bug can be shown diagrammatically as follows

New:
When a bug is found/revealed for the first time, the software tester communicates it to his/her team leader (Test Lead) in order to confirm if that is a valid bog. After getting confirmation from the Test Lead, the software tester logs the bug and the status of New is assigned to the bug

Assigned
After the bug is reported as New it comes to the Development Team. The development Lead verifies if the bug is valid. If the Bug is valid, development leader assign it to developer to fix it and a status of 'Assigned is assigned to it

InProgress:
Once the developer starts working on the bug. he/she changes the status of the bug to InProgress to indicate that he/she is working on it to find a solution.

Open:
Once development lead is verified the bug but it not assigned to any of the developers to fix, because of developers may be busy with other bug or task, that time the bug is moved to the open status. Once the developer get free he will assign the bug to his/her name and changing the status to inprogress.

Fixed
Once the developer makes necessary changes in the code and verifies the code, he/she marks the bug as Fixed and passes it over to the Development Lead in order to pass it to the testing team.

Retest:
The testing team leader changes the status of the bug, which is previously marked with fixed to 'Retest' and assigns it to a tester for retesting

Closed:
After the bug is assigned a status of 'Retest, it is again tested. If the problem is solved. the tester closes it and marks it with 'Closed' Status.

Reopen:
If after retesting the software for the bug opened, if the system behaves in the same way or same bug arises once again, then the tester reopens the bug and again sends it back to the developer marking its status as 'Reopen’.

Rejected:
If the Testing Lead finds that the system is working according to the specification on the bug is invalid as per the explanation from the development, he/she add the  log and marks in status as Rejected.

Postponed
Sometimes, testing of a particular bug has to be postponed for an indefinite period. This station may occur because of many reasons, such as unavailability of Test data, unavailability of particular functionality etc. That time, the bug is marked with Postponed status.

Deferred:
In some cases a particular bug stands no importance and needs to be avoided that time it is marked with Deferred status.




Agile Methodology
------------------

Agile methodology is combination of waterfall model, iterative incremental model, prototype

Agile implemented by
---------------------
Scrum --> Product development
Kanban --> Product is in maintenance

Scrum
-------
application development in to phases --> Milestone (Requirement and time duration)

Sprint -->(1 day, 2 day, 3day, 1 week, 2week, 1month, 2month 3month)
Sprint goal --> what have to be completed
Requirements are maintained in the Backlog(Sprint backlog, product backlog)
Epic is to group the user stories or module
Requirements are converted to a user stories
user stories spliced into task
task can be sliced to subtask


how to create user story
-------------------------
Description
Objective 
Acceptance criteria
user story point(1, 2, 3,4, 8, 12)--> points are used to measure the effort and time taken to complete

1MD - 1sp

1 complexity
2. duration
3. uncertainty

Scrum Team
----------

Product owner --> POC for req
Scrum Master --> he need to implement scrum process and maintain
Dev
Tester
Devops or SRE


Sprint ceremonies 
-----------------
Sprint planning --> Formal meeting, scrum team will be present duration is 1-2hr
			plan and assign userstories for this sprint 
			picking the user stories based on capacity 
			
			1sprint howmuch story point have to be completed by 1 scrum member
			
			capacity = number of person * number of sp/person
			defining sprint goal
Daily standup --> formal or informal meeting
			they will discus about what i have done yesterday, what is the plan for today if they have any blockers or any issue


Sprint Refinement- Formal meeting - user stories:  Discussion about the requiremen
------------------

Sprint Review --> Review of work

Sprint Retrospective --> What when well, what don't

Sprint closure --> They will move the tickets to done if completed or the will carryforward the ticket to next sprint if not completed
		They can check for borndown chart




FACEBOOK
-----------
1. as a user i have to register to the system
2. as a user i have to login the application
3. as a user i have to reset my password
4. as a user i have to post video, image, text
5. as a user i have to i can post like for the post
6. as a user i can able to add friends to the list


Git
-------
Distributed Version control System

Keep track of changes in your code or file
work on multiple versions of project simultaneously
collaborate with team without overwriting each other work
go back in time to any previous version if something goes wrong

Git --> Application it is installed in the system/os
GitHub --> web based git application


Setup Git and GitHub
----------------------
Create Account https://github.com/

Login to the GitHub

Where we are using python
----------------------------
Webapplication development ---> Django, flask
Native application development --> 
Drivers, Middleware, firmware development
ML, AI, Datascience
Automation
cloud computing

Reason 
--------
Architechture --> Interpreted language, Dynamic language, OOPS, Scripting, 
less number of lines to create program because its not following the syntax or systematic language
python is case sensitive, python can be integrated with other tools like DB tools

Architecture 
--------------




Interpreter
------------
interpreter is a set of program which is involved to compile the program

interpreter will compile the program line by line so it is reducing the compilation time

Steps of interpreter
---------------------
1 source code--> have to create program and store in .py format
2. Tokenizer ---> interpreter read the source code and convert the program into smaller tokens 
token means smaller elements
3. Parser --> grammar checkers --> It will collect syntax tree and check the syntax of program or grammar
4.compiler --> convert source code in to bite code
5. PVM --> python virtual machine --> this will covert byte code in to machine specific code and it will pass the machine code to the system


Print in python
--------------

print(object, sep = " ", end ="\n")

\n move the cursor to next line
sep is between the objects


Data Type
-----------

Numeric

	int 
	float
	complex


Sequence Type

	List
	Tuple
	String

Set
	
Dictionary
Boolean



Steps to Configure python project and git repository
-------------------------------------------------------
Create New Repo in git with out readme.md file(the repo should be empty)
create python project in PyCharm
create any file in python project
open terminal in PyCharm
initiate git --> git init
connect to the remote repo ---> git remote add origin https://github.com/sivaneshMK/PythonProjectGuviOct.git
to check the connectivity --> git remote -v
stage your changes --> git add .
move your changes to the local repo git commit -m "initial commit"
move your changes to the remote repo --> git push -u origin master
refresh your remote repo your file will be added to your repo master branch


git status --> current status of your file


MySQL
-----

Data types in MySQL
---------------------
Numeric:
Int, Tinyint(1byte), smallint, Mediumint, Bigint, float, double, 

String
----------------
char
varachar
text
medium text
long text
Enum --> one value from the predefined list
set --> you can pick multiple values from predefined list

Date and time 
--------------
Date
time
Datetime
Timestamp
Year



create table std_details
(
std_id int,
std_name varchar(50),
std_email varchar(255),
std_mobile bigint
)


insert column
---------------
Alter table std_details
Add age int;


change details of clm
----------------------
alter table std_details
modify age float;

drop particular column
--------------------------
alter table std_details drop column std_email;

rename the table
-----------------------
alter table std_details rename to student_details;


Insert data into a table

insert into student_details
values
(1001, 'Karthic', 09876531987, 55);


insert into student_details
values
(1002, 'Boobalan', 09876531983, 44),
(1003, 'Jainprasila', 8938938939, 33);



create table student_mark
(
std_id int,
std_mark int,
std_rank int
);


select * from student_details;

select std_name from student_details;

select std_name, age from student_details;

select * from student_details
where std_name = 'Jainprasila';

select * from student_details
where std_name;


select * from student_details
where std_name like 'Vidhya %';

select * from student_details
where std_name like 'Vidhya %' and age=13;

select * from student_details
where age >=18;

select * from student_details
where age<18;

select max(age) from student_details;

-- select (3) from student_details;




RDBMS
-------
Keys
----
Primary Key  ---> if your defining primary key for the particular column in a table 
	it wont be allow you to store duplicate datas
	it wont allow the null
	address of the record
	it should be the unique value

Foreign Key --> foreign key should be primary key in parent table



Unique Key
composite key

Joins
-------
used to get data from multiple related tables

types
----------
Inner join
	returns records with matching values in both tables

left join
	returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
if no matches return null
	
right join:
	Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table
	
full outer join

							Selenium


Automation Testing:
-------------------
Converting manual test cases in to automation test script by using any of the tools like selenium, Appium, uft, rft, ect.
and executed on the system with out manual intervention.

Why
----
Reduce human errors
reduce dev cost
increase efficiency of testing
reduce time and effort
identify the critical functional errors
to identify the issues in behaviour

When
--------
once the application is ready for test, we can execute the automation test

When you will consider the application for automation?
-------------------------------------------------------
when the application or module is functionally stable
The module or function shouldn't have any critical issues
The test environment is reliable and consistent.


What are the testing tools are in market
-----------------------------------------
selenium, applium, playwright, uft, rft, test complete, tosca, SoapUI, katalon studio, renorex ect


Why selenium
--------------
open source
cross browser testing(chrome, edge, firefox, IE, opera, safari)
multiple programming languages(java, python, ruby, C#, javascript, PHP, pearl)
platform supports
supports CICD(Jenkins, concourse ect.)
strong community base.
frequently we are getting updated versions to support latest browsers and programming languages

Disadvantages of selenium
--------------------------
its not supporting the Windowbased application for automation
can't automate captcha
there is no in build reporting
IT is not following any of the development approaches like tDD or BDD
it is not capable for video recording



History of Selenium
-------------------
2004 - by  Jason Huggins
official web site -- https://www.selenium.dev/history/

first release --> selenium core
second release --> selenium IDE(record and play back)
third release --> selenium RC(Remote control)
fourth release --> webdriver

selenium  2 --> selenium webdriver 

selenium web driver is a combination of webdriver and RC

selenium 3

selenium 4

Selenium components
------------------
selenium core, IDE, RC, WebDriver, Grid



Components of selenium 4
-------------------------
Selenium WebDriver -->It controls browsers through drivers using w3c protocol
Selenium grid  --> manages distributed execution(local/remote) using modern architecture
selenium IDE --> record- and - play back tool for quick script generation
selenium manager --> automatically manages browser drivers(no need to download browser drivers manually)

Features in selenium 4
-------------------------
relative locators --> Find Elements near other elements(above(), below(). near())
Better window and tab handling --> easy to switch between tabs and windows
full page screenshots --> supports all browsers
dev tools protocol integrations --> interacts with chrome dev tools(networks, console logs, performance)
Selenium grid 4 --> uses microservices architecture(Hub+node +router +distributor)


Why we are using python
--------------------------

Easy programming
huge library support
we have different frameworks to develop the automation script and run(pytest, pytestbdd, robot, pyunit)
it will support the 3 party reports aswell(allure report, extent report, pytest html report)
community support.


framework
-----------
it is a organized way of programming(maintain the folder structures)
rules and regulations(to create a program)
it will help you to reduce duplicate programs or it will increase the reusablility of program
easy maintance, clear way of program.


java(3 years), python(4.5), c#, ruby, go lang



Selenium Locators
----------------------
Id
Name
classname
CSSSelector
Xpath
LinkText
PartialLinkText
Tagname



<input> --> input tag
</input> --> closed tag
name = "" --> attribute(property name = property value)
class=""
in between open and closed tag--> text

Compound class name
---------------------
compound classname is not permitted by the class name locator

compound classname means, if any space present inside the class attribute value


Pytest 
----------
framework
it is supports TDD ---> TEst Driven Development
it is have a inbuild report
and also supports 3rd party reports



pytest should have a test file and the file name should be start with or end with  test_* or *_test

same have to be followed for test methods

pip install -r requirements.txt


A virtual environment is an isolated workspace where you can install python
packages separately for each project

this avoids version conflicts like:
	project A need selenium 3.41.5
	project B need selenium 4.5



Create Virtual environment
	python -m venv myenv           

myenv --> is user defined name for virtual environment

Activate Virtual Environmen
	myenv\Scripts\activate


Alerts:
-----------
Alert are also known as JS popup
when we are getting this alerts it has to be handled
if your not handling this in runtime. it will block the other element interactions


File UPload
-------------


WebElement Methods
-------------------
send_keys
click
clear
is_selected
	check or radio
is_displayed
is_enabled
get_attribute
text

<html>
	<ul>
 		<li>
		<li>

WebDriver Method
------------------
get
current_url
title
find_element
find_elements
back
forward
refresh
switchTo






Assignment
--------------
Check Flight is selected
One Way Radio button is Selected(if Not selected raise exception and make test fail)
Select From City  and to city Dynamically(in run time get from city and to city from user)
from city and to city both are same you have throw error

Depature date(dynamic select based on user input)

check regular is default(raise error if not)

click search

check flight list, if nothing raise an error

Check flights are listed based on the price(low to high)

Check listed flight are unique based on flight number
Check selected is highlighted in the flight list page
select view price for the first flight

trip fare popup card should have the same details which we given(from , to , date, flight code and name, depature and arrival time)
select book now
Validate price details based on fare selection, from , to , date, flight code and name, depature and arrival time
follow the other steps and make ticked booked

"test_user_can_search_product	5	verify_text	""//span[contains(text(),'Showing')]/span""	cow dung cake"



Playwright
--------------

Playwright is a automation framework

Built by Microsoft

open source test automation library

it will support , java python, c#, Nodejs(javascript/typescript)

First release --> January 2020

Features
-----------

Cross-browser Testing --> Chrome, firefox, edge, webKit

Multi Language support

Auto Waiting --> waits automatically for elements to be ready

Headless and Headed Mode

Mobile and device emulation --> can emulate devices, screen sizes and geolocations

network interception and mocking --> support the interception of api calls and mocks responses for improved test control

Built in test generator --> record actions to auto generate code for test scripts

Visual and screenshot testing --> full screen screenshot, element snap, video recordings

inbuild reports

Limitations of playwright
--------------------------
it wont support Native Mobile apps


Setup playwright
-----------------
python project
install playwright, pytest
playwright install

locators
--------------
get_by_role() --> best practice
get_by_test_id()
get_by_label()
get_by_text()
locator()     --> xpath and CSS



BDD --> Behavior driven development   - TDD  --> Test Driven Development
----------------------

TDD--> is kind of programming format
to understand the test the user need programming knowledge

BDD
----
contains keywords

each test step is converted to keywords

keywords are like business terms

BDD --> UAT(User Acceptance testing) BA perform the UAT --> BA wont have the programming knowledge so if we are using BDD then they can understand what is there in test, and they analyse the test coverage

if stackholders have to check the test coverage, it is very easy for them if the test is in BDD


To implement this BDD --> We are using a gherkin language --> gherkin is look like a normal English letters
gherkin have some inbuild keywords aswell

Given
When
Then
And

Scenario
Scenarios
Feature
Example
ScenarioOutline
Background


Gherkin is business readable language used in bdd, mainly with tools like cucumber, pytest-bdd
specflow, it helps non technical stackholders, testers, and developers understand test scenarios in plain englsh

Why Gherkin
-----------------
Written in plain English
easy for business +qa+ stacholders + developers
Act as living documentations
Directly maps to automation code

.feature --> feature file it contains gherkin keywords and bdd structured test cases

Login.feature
------------------

Feature: Login Functionality

	Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
		
		Given user is on the login page

		When user enters valid username and password
		And clicks on login button

		Then user should be redirected to the dash board



Signup.feature
--------------

Feature: Signup Feature
	
	Scenario: Retail User Successful Signup
		
		Given user is on the sign up page
		
		When user enters pan number and dob
		And click on signup button

		Then user should redirected to the logindetails step
		
			
	
Hooks
-----
hooks is a set of code

it will be executed before and after your scenario, step, entire test session

mainly used for browser setup, teardown, logging, screen shot capture on failure, and attaching data to allure report

Example: after automation test execution clearing the data from DB to make environment clean and the same data can be reused





Data Tables
-----------

this is used to pass data to the test step

we can create data table for each steps

it will be used widely on field validation




Robot Framework
_____________________

Nokia

Easy to read plain English syntax
open source , keyword driven test automation framework written in python. 
it is widely used for web, api, mobile, desktop automation and fits well for both qa teams and BA

Build on python and we can extend python libraries
Supports BDD style testing

rich ecosystem(selenium, Appium, api, DB, etc.)

excellent HTML & log reports

strong CI/CD support


Robot Framework architecture
------------------------------
Test case(.robot)
|
|
|
Keywords(Built-in/library/custom python)
|
|
|
Libraries(Selenium Library, RequestsLibrary, etc.)
|
|
python + automation tools



Setup
--------------
pip install robotframework
pip install robotframewor-selenimlibrary


CI/CD
--------

Continues integration and Continues Delivery



Jenkins--> is kind of hub --> it is integrated with multiple dev tools
Ex: Git --> MySQL

coding --> git(Pr) --> it will fetch code from --> Triggers the Unit test         --> it will deploy the code 
                        git hub                     and it will execute the test       in to test environment
                                                    and share the repot in mail or 
                                                    slack


 
---> fetch the automation code  --> trigger sanity automated test --> trigger full regress--> Deployed to the  
	from git hub                                                                            UAT
	and it will perform 
	smoke test


---> UAT Testing will be performed              --> deploy the code in to prod
      Performance testing and security testing


Devops   ---> they configure all this things
---------
